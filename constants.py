**Project:** Brand Alignment of Text-to-image Generation Models

**Purpose of Study / Aim:** This study aims to understand human preferences in evaluating image alignment with brand identity. We are conducting research to validate an AI model's ability to predict which images are more aligned with brand identity. Your participation will help improve automated systems for generating and evaluating marketing imagery.

**Task:** I understand that I will be asked to fill a survey questionnaire. I will be asked basic questions around my advertisement consumption and social media exposure. I will be shown pairs of AI-generated images along with a reference brand image. I will select which of the generated images better aligns with the brand's visual identity.

**Effort:** The survey contains 30 image comparison questions. The estimated time required to complete the survey is 8-10 minutes.

**Benefits:** My participation will help advance understanding of automated systems to evaluate brand alignment in AI-generated imagery.

**Voluntary participation:** I understand that my participation is strictly voluntary and anonymous.

**Risks:** I understand that there are no major risks, or feelings of discomfort I would experience when taking part in the study, as it involves only filling responses to the survey questionnaire.

**Confidentiality:** I understand the survey is anonymous. Only the responses to questions will be collected and stored. The data collected will be kept confidential, under the supervision and responsibility of PIs. Only aggregated statistics will be reported in a scientific paper as a result of this study. No personally identifiable information will be used in the publication/dissemination of the results.
